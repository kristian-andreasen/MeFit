## Pull request guidelines

After the changes are made in your branch, you're ready to submit a pull request.
Please follow the Conventional Commits specification for writing commit messages: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

#### Considerations before submitting a pull request

- Did you manually test your new change?
- Does your pull request fix multiple issues? If so, you may consider breaking into separate pull requests.
- Expect review and discussion. If you cannot back up your changes with a good description and through review, please reconsider whether it should be done at all.

#### Each pull request should include

- a descriptive title
- a short summary of the changes
- a reference to the issue that it fixes
- steps to test the fix (if applicable)
- for design-related changes, it is helpful to include screenshots
